# 🌟 Advanced Project: Heart Disease and Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart disease and diabetes using various machine learning algorithms. The datasets used are the **Heart Disease dataset** and the **Indians Diabetes Dataset**. The goal is to classify whether a patient has heart disease or diabetes based on various health measurements.

## 📊 Datasets
- **Heart Disease dataset**: Features include 'age', 'sex', 'cp', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'fbs', 'restecg', 'thalach', 'exang', 'oldpeak', 'slope', 'ca', 'thal'. Target variable is 'target'.
- **Indians Diabetes Dataset**: Features include 'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age'. Target variable is 'Outcome'.

## 📂 Data Preprocessing
Essential steps include importing necessary libraries, reading the datasets, and performing initial exploration and cleaning to ensure the data is ready for analysis.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA includes visualizing the distribution of features and examining correlations. For heart disease, correlation matrices and distribution plots are created. For diabetes, descriptive statistics and distribution of the outcome variable are analyzed.

## 🧹 Data Normalization
Normalization is applied to features with high variance to improve model performance. For heart disease, features like 'trestbps', 'chol', and 'thalach' are normalized.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
Various machine learning models are implemented for both heart disease and diabetes prediction, including:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) (for diabetes)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## 🚀 Model Training and Evaluation
The datasets are split into training and testing sets. Evaluation metrics used include accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score to assess model performance.

## 📈 Project Impact
By predicting heart disease and diabetes effectively, these models can aid healthcare professionals in early diagnosis, prevention strategies, and tailored treatment plans, significantly impacting patient care.
